Birth Software aims to bear a new kind of software, which is reliable, fast and secure.

The flagship project of Birth Software, which at the same time gives it its name, is a new operating system. This operating system started being written in Zig, but the shortcomings of the language and the compiler, despite being great to most of the existing ones out there, made the author try to write his own language and compiler.

For that purpose, the current project being developed by Birth Software is Nativity, a systems programming language and a compiler, which aims to compile many lines per second, while still retaining output machine code quality with an (optional) LLVM backend.
